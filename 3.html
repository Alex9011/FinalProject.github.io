            <h3>Death Note</h3>
            <p>To live or not to live is determined by the gods of death, sooner or later entering his name in a special notebook. One of these notebooks falls into the human world on the territory of modern Japan. And what happens if the notebook of the god Death Note is in the hands of a person? The answer is obvious: he imagines himself to be God. This is what happens to Yagami Light - an average, but not quite ordinary high school student who dreams of building a utopia on the corpses of criminals.
Death Note gained incredible popularity at the beginning of the century online, making the story of the confrontation between Kira and the genius detective L a classic of the detective genre and just a cult anime.</p>

            <h3>Attack of the Titans</h3>
            <p>Cornered humanity is living out its last days under the yoke of titans - mysterious creatures that terrorize the human race. Survivors huddle behind the walls of a large settlement with their own government, representing the last stronghold of centralized power in the world. A young man named Eren also lives there, spending his childhood in relative safety, until an extraordinary event occurs: the titans break into the city, destroying everything in their path. After the invasion of the giants, Eren becomes an orphan and vows to destroy every single titan. On the way to his goal, he and his friends join the reconnaissance squad, engaged in forays behind the wall. The hero does not yet know how many mysteries the outside world conceals in himself. The adaptation of the manga about the adventures of Eren and his comrades Shingeki no Kyojin "blew up" the global anime community in 2013 and attracted many fans of Japanese animation.
