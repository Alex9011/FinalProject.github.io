            <h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
            <p>The action takes place in a world where there is a certain organization of Hunters. Their license gives them many privileges - the ability to travel free of charge in the first classes of various types of transport, access to information that is closed to other people and the right to take large sums of money from banks. Because of this, there are quite a lot of people who want to become Hunters. Therefore, an exam is held annually, at which those few who really deserve to be a Hunter are selected.

            <h3>Fairy Tail</h3>
            <p>Once a young witch named Lucy decided to join the most famous guild of wizards called Fairy Tale.
The magicians of this guild worked for hired money, so you do not have to be bored - what is not a day, it is a new task! Isn't this the best Guild in the world, where the strongest magicians are gathered and where it will definitely not be boring, because there is always something to do?
But nothing is so simple. Not a particularly cloudless future, most likely, awaits a fragile girl who will be in a team with crazy guys, each of whom has his very strong abilities, seasoned with their personal jumps and thoughtless antics.
and with such a team she will not only get along, but also perform tasks and get into various adventures! It will not be boring - that's for sure.
